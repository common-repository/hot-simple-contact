Hot Simple Contact is a simple but very useful, configurable and responsive-friendly plugin that allows your clients to contact you through your site.

== Description ==

Almost every website require a contact form that potential clients use to send email to the site administrators. We developed Hot Simple Contact mainly for usage on our [WordPress themes](http://hot-themes.com/ "WordPress themes"), then decided to share it to the public. This plugin doesn't have too many complex parameters. You can define the contact form's width in any unit or use auto parameter, which is ideal for all responsive websites. You can disable some of the fields to make the contact form even simpler. We believe you already have a form of spam protection, but additional protection from spam bots is always welcome. Therefore Hot Simple Contact plugin has anti-spam field that allows you to create your own question and answer that will protect your site from sending emails automatically by spam bots.

This plugin can be used as a widget or you can include it into your posts through a shortcode which may contain parameters.

== Installation ==

1. Install plugin as usually from WordPress.org. You can also manually download it, unpack and upload `plugin_hot_simple_contact` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. To access the plugin's settings, go to Settings > Hot Simple Contact. There you can set width, intro and after text, disable some fields and set the anti-spam protection.
4. To insert the contact form into your posts, you can use shortcode: {simplecontact}{/simplecontact}. This contact form will use the common plugin's settings.
5. It's possible to configure the form through the shortcode. In this case use this format: {simplecontact}Sample intro text,noname,nosubject,noantispam,Sample after text{/simplecontact}. In this example, we disabled name, subject and anti-spam fields. You should change intro and after text. To enable fields use this example: {simplecontact}Sample intro text,name,subject,antispam,Sample after text{/simplecontact}.
6. To create a contact form widget, drag the Hot Simple Contact widget into the available widget sidebar and configure it. Widget parameters overwrite common plugin settings.
